# CLAUDE.md — Session Handoff

Read this FIRST when picking up a PainTraverse session. For the aesthetic
north star, read `DESIGN.md` next.

## Project at a glance

- **PainTraverse** — Electron + React + TypeScript + Three.js + Pixi.js
  procedural town generator. Main target: a real-time 3D walkaround that
  reads as a Traverse Town-like dusk scene at 30+ FPS.
- **Primary entry**: `src/renderer/renderer3d/ThreeRenderer.ts` — the
  3D scene, camera, shadows, composer, particle systems, render loop.
- **Build/run commands**:
  - `npm run typecheck` — tsc --noEmit (must be green before commit)
  - `npm run build` — production build (must be green before commit)
  - `npm run dev` — electron dev (user runs themselves; don't start it)

## Working tone

- Saturday-morning-fun energy. Ambitious, a bit playful, not precious.
- User is authorized for big blind sprints with multiple commits per session.
- Don't ask permission for each small change; push and show.
- When user drops a debug dump, read it, diagnose, fix, ship.

## Git workflow

- **Work directly on `main`.** The user wants changes shipped to main every
  commit — this is their durable preference, overriding the default
  safety of "never push to main". Do NOT create side branches or open
  PRs unless explicitly asked.
- **Commits**: Frequent, small-to-medium. Clear messages focused on WHY.
  End commit body with the full context of what changed.
- **Push**: Always `git push origin main`. Retry on network error with
  exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, 16s).
- **Never force-push.** Never use `--no-verify`. If hooks fail, fix the
  underlying issue and create a new commit.

## Debug-dump workflow

The user creates debug dumps from the running app and uploads them via
GitHub commits. To process:

```bash
git pull origin claude/explore-repo-w4X5k
ls -lat debug-dumps/*.html | head -3
```

Then extract the latest dump's image and diagnostic JSON:

```bash
python3 -c "
import re, base64, os, json
p = 'debug-dumps/<LATEST>.html'
html = open(p).read()
os.makedirs('/tmp/debug-out', exist_ok=True)
for i, m in enumerate(re.finditer(r'class=\"label\">([^<]+)</div><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,([A-Za-z0-9+/=]+)\"', html)):
    with open(f'/tmp/debug-out/{i:02d}.png', 'wb') as f: f.write(base64.b64decode(m.group(2)))
m = re.search(r'<pre[^>]*>(.*?)</pre>', html, re.DOTALL)
body = m.group(1).replace('&quot;','\"').replace('&lt;','<').replace('&gt;','>').replace('&amp;','&')
data = json.loads(body)
print(json.dumps(data.get('threeRenderer'), indent=2))
"
```

Then `Read` the extracted PNG to see the scene. The diagnostic JSON shows:
- `fps` (real wall-clock now, not lied-about)
- `camera` — position, yaw/pitch, flyMode, fov
- `render.drawCalls` — honest per-frame count (autoReset=false)
- `render.triangles` / `geometries` / `textures`
- `frameMs` — { total, update, render } split
- `renderSettings` — shadowMapSize, type, bloom state, composer state
- `particles` — { smoke, firefly, bird } counts
- `scene` — { buildingCount, propCount, terrainCount }

**Only use the latest dump.** Older dumps don't reflect current code.

## Critical files map

### Rendering (3D)
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/ThreeRenderer.ts` — main renderer, scene, loop
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/BuildingFactory.ts` — per-building mesh emission,
  chimneys, foundation stair-step plinth, `coalesceWalls()` post-merge
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/PropFactory.ts` — lampposts, trees, props, lamp pool
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/TerrainMesh.ts` — ground mesh (corner heights),
  retaining walls (threshold-gated), water, road surface (CobbleTexture)
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/CobbleTexture.ts` — procedural voronoi cobble
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/LanternStrings.ts` — overhead rope+lantern chains
  AND `buildWallLanterns()` — wall-mounted eye-level lanterns
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/FacadeTexture.ts` — procedural window/wall textures
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/architecture/VolumeRenderer.ts` — `emitVolume`,
  `_wallMatCache`, `tickWallEmissive` (flicker)
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/architecture/Massing.ts` — building massing templates
- `src/renderer/renderer3d/BatchedMeshBuilder.ts` — shared merge helper

### Generation
- `src/renderer/generation/TownGenerator.ts` — street network, district zoning,
  building placement (Phase B walks road edges + row-streak extension),
  vegetation, props
- `src/renderer/generation/noise.ts` — SimplexNoise + fbm

### UI
- `src/renderer/ui/panels/RenderPanel.tsx` — debug dump export (embeds
  screenshot + settings JSON + threeRenderer diagnostics)

## Key numbers / constants

- `FLOOR_HEIGHT = 1.8` (BuildingFactory) — 1.05 was the "kaiju" scale bug
- `TERRAIN_WORLD_SCALE = 1.8` (TerrainMesh) — raw height unit → world
- `EYE_HEIGHT = 1.6` (ThreeRenderer) — player camera height
- `SHADOW_RADIUS = 28m` (ThreeRenderer.updateShadowCamera) — follows player
- Shadow map 512² (was 1024²) with PCF (was PCFSoft)
- Bloom at half-resolution; composer gated off 8am–3pm
- Row-streak: 2–4 buildings extended along road tangent, continuity
  bonus 0.7 on adjacent-to-existing edges
- Lantern strings max 25 per map, distance 2.6–5.0 tiles, 3 lanterns each
- Wall lanterns on ~18% of buildings at 2.4m height
- Birds: 5 spires × 3 birds = max 15. Dusk-only visible.
- Smoke: 4 particles × 16 chimneys = 64 max

## Hard-won lessons (don't repeat)

- **FPS counter was dishonest** — it used `dt` capped at 0.1s, so at 2 real
  FPS it reported 10. Fixed to `performance.now()`. If you need accurate
  timing, use `_frameStats.frameMs`.
- **renderer.info.render was unreliable** until we set `autoReset=false`
  and snapshot manually. The post-composer OutputPass overwrites counts.
- **Lamp pool as a vertical cone looked like a teepee.** As a vertical
  sprite looked like a floating disc. As a HORIZONTAL plane lying on the
  ground with radial-alpha, it reads as a real light pool. Don't revert.
- **Cobble pucks look alien** sitting on top of the cobble TEXTURE —
  they read as black disks, not stones. Texture alone sells cobbles.
- **Terrain stair-step cliffs** came from the ground mesh using ONE
  tileH for all 4 corners of each quad. Corner-shared heights (cornerH
  helper in buildGroundWithHeight) fixed it.
- **FLOOR_HEIGHT = 1.05 made buildings too short** relative to the
  1.6m player eye height — "kaiju scale." Bumped to 1.8.
- **Mood mix "bright" (255,255,160-210) clipped to white under bloom**
  at dusk, reading as a blown-out window. Clamped to warm amber.
- **Flicker at 2.2–4.4 Hz read as strobe.** Dropped to 0.25–0.7 Hz.
- **Shadow cam on town-radius was wasteful.** Now follows camera at 28m
  radius — sharper shadows AND fewer casters in frustum.

## Current state summary (as of last commit)

- Scale fixed (FLOOR_HEIGHT 1.8), lamp pools as ground discs, chimneys
  anchored to mainBody with 7 whimsical variants
- Terrain slopes continuously (corner-shared heights, retaining walls
  gated at 0.6m drop)
- Cobble texture via procedural voronoi + grout, pucks removed
- Window moods warm-clamped, flicker slow (0.25–0.7 Hz ±4%)
- Lamp pools horizontal discs with radial alpha
- Lanterns in three layers: overhead rope strings, wall-mounted at 2.4m,
  plus ground pools under lampposts
- Birds circle tall spires at dusk only
- Row-streak placement (continuity 0.7, 2-4 tangent extensions, ±1
  floor variation)
- Tower-house whimsy (4% of buildings get +2 floors)
- Coalesced wall meshes (merge 2+ same-material into 1 mesh)
- Shadow: 512² map, PCF, camera-follow at 28m radius
- Bloom half-res, composer gated in daytime
- Debug dump exposes honest FPS, draw calls, frame time split

## What's still open / what to push on next

Ordered by aesthetic impact per effort:

1. **Generator still places buildings from tile corners** — they don't
   always align to street edges cleanly. Investigate whether buildings
   are ever cut off by roads.
2. **Facade detail** — windows are squares. Adding trim (lintels, sills)
   or timber framing lines around windows would add texture at distance.
3. **Shop signs projecting perpendicular to walls** — medieval/Diagon-Alley
   signature. Market/artisan districts only.
4. **Awnings over market-district doors** — canvas strips extending 0.5m
   from the wall.
5. **Building corners: vary with age.** Older buildings slump, lean
   slightly. Add small `leanZ` on ~15% of buildings.
6. **Perf: look at what's still driving draw calls.** 1389 was the last
   count. Target <500 at dusk walkaround. Post-composer adds ~15;
   shadow doubles scene meshes. Scene geometry is ~600 meshes —
   coalescing can go lower if threshold drops to 1 (merge singletons too)
   but risks losing frustum culling.
